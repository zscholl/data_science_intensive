# Repository for Springboard's Data Science Intensive Course

    v)      project

# Project
    This directory contains all files related to the capstone project. Right now it contains two sub-directories, grouping, and cleaning. These two directories contain all python notebooks that have been used to group and clean data prior to any statistical analysis. 
    The parent directory contains the milestone report as well as a python notebook used for initial statistical analysis.

# Note
    All project directories contain a data directory and an ipython notebook file. Each notebook can be run with jupyter notebook. The first_data_story project does not contain a data directory because the data source is too large to upload to github.
